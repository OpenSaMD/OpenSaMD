<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Radiotherapy AI’s contour recommendations product is deployed onsite as a DICOM
server. It is designed to sit between your centre’s CT scanner and your
treatment planning system.</p>
<p>When patients undergo their simulation images are auto-sent through to
Radiotherapy AI’s DICOM server. The patient identifying information within the
DICOM header is then encrypted with a client side encryption key, and then
these patient scans are then securely submitted to Google Cloud infrastructure
within Sydney to undergo contouring.</p>
<p>These contours are converted into an RT-DICOM Structure Set file and are then
sent back to the Radiotherapy AI DICOM server for subsequent forwarding through
to the centre’s treatment planning system for refinement by the clinical
Radiation Oncologist or Radiation Therapist (the health practitioner) according
to the site’s contouring protocols.</p>
<p>In practice, the health practitioner does not directly interact with
Radiotherapy AI’s software. Instead, the results from Radiotherapy AI’s
software is provided to your centre’s treatment planning system for the health
practitioners subsequent refinement.</p>
<p>A digram outlining the dataflow pipeline is provided within
<a class="reference internal" href="#pipeline"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 1</span></a>:</p>

</div>
<p>The contouring algorithm that is applied to the CT scans is based off of
historical data that has been created for prior patient treatments while
following the clinical protocols. It is the intent of the contouring
recommendation algorithm to mimic those clinical protocols.</p>

<div class="section" id="user-training-and-knowledge">
<h3>User training and knowledge<a class="headerlink" href="#user-training-and-knowledge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The contours provided by the Radiotherapy AI Contour Recommendations software
are a recommendation only. When be used to support clinical radiotherapy
treatment these contours are to be provided to a RANZCR certified Radiation
Oncologist or an ASMIRT certified Radiation Therapist for subsequent refinement
according to that clinic’s approved contouring protocols.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="used-in-cases-where-there-is-already-a-clinically-implemented-contouring-protocol">
<h3>Used in cases where there is already a clinically implemented contouring protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#used-in-cases-where-there-is-already-a-clinically-implemented-contouring-protocol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For each contour provided by the software to the user, the user needs to be
able to validate the contour against the clinically implemented contouring
protocol, and if needed, either refine the provided contour to come into
alignment with the protocol, or potentially completely redraw the contour.</p>
<p>Either a network file path or an intranet URL that references the corresponding
contouring protocols is to be provided by the customer organisation to
Radiotherapy AI so that within each DICOM ROI Description field this protocol
reference can be displayed. It is expected that the software that the user
utilises to validate/refine the contours provides a means for the user to
clearly view this imported DICOM field.</p>
<p>This is to be inline with the following requirement for exempt clinical
decision support software (CDSS) <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/clinical-decision-support-software.pdf">as per the TGA</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Exempted CDSS devices must clearly reference the basis of the
recommendations, including the source(s) of information used (e.g. specific
clinical guideline, hospital procedure) so that the information can be
independently reviewed by the user. The user may rely on their own judgement
and reach a recommendation without primarily relying on the software
function.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="provides-a-recommendation-only-and-is-not-intended-to-replace-clinical-judgement">
<h3>Provides a recommendation only and is not intended to replace clinical judgement<a class="headerlink" href="#provides-a-recommendation-only-and-is-not-intended-to-replace-clinical-judgement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The software provides unapproved DICOM-RT Structure set files. These are then
sent through to a contour drawing, refining and approval system, either a TPS
or a dedicated contouring software system.</p>
<p>The health practitioner, either a Radiation Oncologist or a Radiation
Therapist, is to use their clinical judgement to decide whether or not
refinement is appropriate before approval and whether or not approval is
appropriate at all. This clinical judgement is to be informed by the
department’s published contouring protocols to which the software’s recommended
contours can be directly compared.</p>
<p>The software is not to be used in situations where the software provides
recommendations that cannot be corroborated with current published clinical
protocols.</p>
<p>It is by this intended use that criteria 2 and 3 for CDSS to be considered
exempt is met:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Criteria 2</strong>: It is intended only for the purpose of providing or
supporting a recommendation to a health professional about prevention,
diagnosis, curing or alleviating a disease, ailment, defect or injury.</p>

<h3>Limited by case validation of the deployed model<a class="headerlink" href="#limited-by-case-validation-of-the-deployed-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is intended that the usage of the model be limited to cases where the model
has been validated for the combination of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Contours based on the clinically utilised protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Patient population demographics such as age group, sex, race and disease
state</p></li>
<li><p>Imaging region</p></li>
<li><p>Patient orientation</p></li>
<li><p>Imaging device</p></li>
<li><p>Imaging modality</p></li>
<li><p>Imaging parameters such as energy, resolution, reconstruction kernels, MRI
sequences</p></li>
<li><p>Scenario induced imaging artifacts such as metal spinal implants, dental
work, metal hips</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended way to validate that the model appropriately handles the above
cases is to collect a representative clinical dataset of the above for model
validation, and if necessary a further independent dataset for model
refinement.</p>
<p>For new models this representative sample can be utilised in unison with the
provided tools to readily undergo bulk validation and investigation.</p>

<p>The software is intended to receive DICOM files that conform to the DICOM
standard. The software that it provides results to is intended to receive and
appropriately handle standards compliant DICOM structure files. It is not
intended to directly interface with another medical device except via this
standard DICOM input output (either file based or DICOM network protocol based).</p>
<p>It is by this intended use that criteria 1 for CDSS to be considered exempt is
met:</p>

<h3>Pseudonymisation key for patient header information<a class="headerlink" href="#pseudonymisation-key-for-patient-header-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Identifying patient header information is pseudonymised so that reversal is
only achievable via a key that is never sent to the Radiotherapy AI cloud
server. This key is stored within the Windows Credential manager vault within
the operating system where the local Radiotherapy AI DICOM server is installed.</p>
<p>This key is to be treated with the same level of protection as the patient
information it is encrypting. The Windows Credential vault is encrypted by the
OS using the Windows account login password. It is expected that both
access to that account and its account password meets requirements appropriate
to the protection of identifying patient information.</p>

<h3>Validation of pseudonymisation undergone with a representative sample<a class="headerlink" href="#validation-of-pseudonymisation-undergone-with-a-representative-sample" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Radiotherapy AI DICOM server can be configured to not send files to the
cloud but to instead send the pseudonymised data either to file, or to another
piece of software via a DICOM send. This utility is to be used after
installation, and after any upgrades to the DICOM server that adjust the
pseudonymisation to verify that the appropriate header items within the DICOM
file have been appropriately de-identified by the installed server.</p>

<p>Only identifying patient information that is stored within the standards
compliant DICOM header is pseudonymised before sending to the cloud sever.</p>
<p>The DICOM software can be configured to only send through certain DICOM file
types. By default this is CT, MRI and RT-DICOM specific files. This is to help
prevent bulk DICOM sends containing other DICOM types that sometimes have burnt
in pixel data included having those extra images included in the
pseudonymisation + upload.</p>

<h3>Be installed on a server with appropriate network and internet bandwidth<a class="headerlink" href="#be-installed-on-a-server-with-appropriate-network-and-internet-bandwidth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to receive DICOM structure results in a timely fashion the provided
network and internet bandwidth, in particular the upload bandwidth, needs to
meet the requirements of the clinic. For a 200 slice CT scan at 512 kB per
slice the resulting 100 MB dataset needs to be able to be uploaded to the cloud
server for the model to create the contours. A 1 Gbit/s upload (top tier fibre
NBN) will upload this data in ~1 second. A 20 Mbit/s upload connection (copper
NBN) will upload this data in ~1 minute. A 1 Mbit/s upload connection (ADSL2+)
will upload this data in ~15 minutes.</p>
<p>Hospital and network traffic can cause upload bottlenecks. Enterprise routers
can be configured using “Quality of Service” so as to prioritise uploads from
specific servers.</p>

<p>Through the dashboard interface users can designate warning and alert
