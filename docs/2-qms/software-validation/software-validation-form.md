### 6.5 Conclusion

Approving the software for use is recommended due to the acceptance criteria being fulfilled completely.

## 7. Proof of Validation

> You can optionally insert screenshots for proof of validation. Strictly speaking, this is not a hard
> requirement by the standards but it's nice to show when you're being audited.

## 10. Annex: Additional Information for Criticality Classification

**GAMP Implications**

- GAMP 5 always leads to "high" software criticality
- GAMP 4 always leads to a "high" or "moderate" software criticality, depending on further risk assessment in step 4.2
- GAMP 1 and 3 typically leads to a "low" or "moderate" software criticality, depending on further risk assessment in step 4.2

**Criticality High**

- A software failure can lead to physical harm requiring medical intervention
- Software controls parameters or data that are essential during product release
- Software manages data relevant for clinical evaluation or product approval
- Software manages data from which conclusions about incident messages or recall actions are drawn

**Criticality Moderate**

- A software failure can lead to physical damage requiring medical intervention
- Software administers documents whose loss endangers the certification
- Software controls intermediate results in the product realization, which are revealed in later steps by
  other processes

**Criticality Low**

- Software manages documents that play a role in the QM system, and whose loss would lead to an audit variance
