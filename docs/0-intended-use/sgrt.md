# Surface guided radiotherapy

The surface guided radiotherapy (SGRT) component of {{device_name}} covers the
following intended uses:

- Patient alignment and setup support during radiotherapy treatments via
  patient surface guidance.
- Treatment machine gating via patient surface tracking.
- Alignment of radiotherapy simulation images into breathing phases to support
  the treatment workflow.

## Intended Medical Indication

<!-- > Describe the condition(s) and/or disease(s) to be screened, monitored,
> treated, diagnosed, or prevented by your software. Importantly, also list
> exclusion criteria: Maybe patients with a certain diagnosis should not be
> using your device. -->

## Contraindications

<!-- > List anything that you want to explicitly exclude from your intended use. -->

## Patient Population

<!-- > Describe the patient population your software is intended to be used on. Note
> that this may overlap with the user profile (section below), but not
> necessarily. Your software could be used by physicians to diagnose diseases
> in patients, so in that case, they don't overlap. Some ideas for
> characteristics to describe: Age group, weight range, health, condition(s). -->

## User Profile

<!-- > Describe the typical user of the software. Some ideas could be:
> Qualifications, prior training (for your software), technical proficiency,
> time spent using the software. -->

## Use Environment Including Software/Hardware

<!-- > Describe the typical use environment. What sort of devices is this running
> on? Does the software only run on one device or on multiple devices? Is it
> loud and chaotic like in an emergency ward? How's the lighting?
>
> Also, add other software or hardware which is required by your device. Most
> commonly, apps require users to have a smartphone with a compatible operating
> system (iOS / Android). -->

## Operating Principle

<!-- > It's kind of a stretch to describe the "operating principle" of software. I
> guess this makes more sense for hardware devices. In any case, I'd just
> generally state what sort of input goes in and what output comes out, e.g.
> you could be processing images and returning diagnoses. -->
