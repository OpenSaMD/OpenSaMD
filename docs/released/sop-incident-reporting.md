## Summary

This SOP describes how we handle (potential) incidents. Specifically, it
outlines how we follow the requirements for the reporting of and necessary
immediate action for adverse events.

## General Considerations

### Reportable Incident

Any incident that our organization becomes aware of is reportable, if one of
our medical devices could be its cause and if it fulfils the definition of an
incident as outlined in this process. Potential incidents are assessed based on
our respective template form for incident assessment [reference document ID
here].

A medical device incident is defined as "any malfunction or deterioration in
the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy
in the labelling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly,
**might lead to or might have led** to the death of a patient, user or other
person or to a serious deterioration in their state of health" (see MEDDEV
2.12./1). Examples are (non-exclusively):

- malfunctioning (e.g. a software bug) of one of our medical devices
- incorrect labelling, instruction for use or advertising material
- usability deficiency causing a misuse

A serious deterioration in state of health includes at least one of the following:

- life-threatening illness
- permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body
  structure
- a condition which requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of
  the above
- any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic result when
  used within manufacturer's instructions for use

<!-- > Note that: not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in
> health. The non-occurrence of such a result might have been due to fortunate
> circumstances or to the intervention of healthcare personnel. It is
> sufficient that: (a) an incident associated with a device happened, and (b)
> the incident was such that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or
> serious deterioration in health. -->

### Field Safety Corrective Action (FSCA)

A field safety corrective action (FSCA) is an action taken to reduce a risk of
death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with a device
that is already placed on the market. Such actions, whether related to direct
or indirect harm, should be reported and informed about via a field safety
notice. FSCAs can include (non-exclusively):

- the return of a medical device to the manufacturer (recall)
- modification of a medical device, which can include: design changes (e.g.
  software update), permanent or temporary changes to the labelling or the
  instructions for use, changes to make device temporarily not available to
  users (software lock)
- advice provided by the manufacturer regarding the use or operation of the
  device

### Reporting Timescale

- In the event of imminent danger:
  - **Immediately** (without any delay that could not be justified)
- In the event of a serious public health threat:
  - **Immediately** after a link was established between the device and the
    event, **but no later than 2 elapsed calendar days** following the date of
    awareness of the event.
- Death or serious deterioration in state of health:
  - **immediately** after a link was established between the device and the
    event, **but no later than 10 elapsed calendar days** following the date of
    awareness of the event.
- Other reportable incidents:
  - **Immediately** after a link was established between the device and the
    event, **but not later than 15 elapsed calendar days** following the date
    of awareness of the event.
- Field Safety Corrective Action (FSCA):
  - **Immediately**, at latest with the beginning of the implementation of
    actions.

All report times refer to when the national responsible authority must first be
notified. In case of uncertainty whether the incident has to be reported or
not, it is reported within the above deadlines.

### Responsible Authorities

Incidents are reported to the authority of the country in which the reportable
incident occurred:

**Other national authorities:**

More contact data can be found under
[this link on the website of the European Commission][other-authorities].

FSCA is reported to the authorities in the countries in which the FSCA is
carried out, including incidents which occurred outside of the European
Economic Area (EEA) but resulted in a recall within European countries.

In parallel to reporting incidents to responsible authorities, our Notified
Body is informed where applicable in respect to the applied conformity
assessment procedure.

## Process Steps

### 1. Documentation, Investigation and Evaluation of Incidents

Any employee of the company that obtains knowledge of an event with a
potentially negative impact on the state of health shall immediately notify the
Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC) to initiate this process.

In a first step, the PRRC investigates the root causes of the event to
determine if there is a causal relationship between the use of the medical
device and the event. The investigation is documented as a CAPA. If there is no
causal relationship, the event is not considered a reportable incident.

If there is a relationship, the PRRC secondly evaluates if the event qualifies
as a reportable incident by filling out our template form for incident
assessment [reference document ID here].

In the case of uncertainty, the event is reported as a reportable incident.

| Participants                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (MDSO / PRRC) |

| Input                                                           | Output                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Event with a potentially negative impact on the state of health | Completed investigation and evaluation of the event |

### 2. Reporting of Incidents

Within the applicable reporting timescale (see general considerations above),
the PRRC informs the responsible national authority about the event using
respective reporting forms. S/he compiles and provides a report with all
information required and available at the time.

If applicable, a copy of the report is sent to the Notified Body involved in
the conformity assessment procedure of the device.

| Participants                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (MDSO / PRRC) |

| Input                                                  | Output                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Completed investigation and evaluation of the incident | Completed reporting to authorities (and Notified Body) |

### 3. Decision on Immediate Action (FSCA)

Based on a risk and root cause analysis of the event, the PRRC decides if field
safety corrective actions (FSCA) are required to reduce existing risks.
Possible FSCAs are described as part of the general considerations of this
process.

Before actions are taken, we inform users / customers about such as part of a
field safety notice (FSN). The FSN is written in the language of the respective
country and must at minimum include:

- Subject: **Safety Alert**
- Manufacturer information (e.g. contact details)
- Information to identify the affected devices (e.g. device name and software
  version)
- Description of the incident problem including resulting risks and the reasons
  for FSCA
- If applicable, actions recommended to the user / customer. For example, this
  could include actions to restore the safety or recommended clinical
  investigations.

All FSCAs are documented as part of the CAPA. A copy of the FSN shall be
archived. Customers confirm the receipt of FSNs as well as the implementation
of recommended actions. If a customer does not respond, at least three attempts
for delivery should be made. It is also documented as part of the CAPA if all
attempts to inform a customer were unsuccessful.

<!-- > You may want to consider a separate process regarding the handling of
> non-conforming products. This process would entail labeling instructions for
> respective product code and instructions for employees handling those
> products. -->

| Participants                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (MDSO / PRRC) |

| Input                         | Output                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Risks resulting from incident | Implemented FSCA, including FSN |

### 4. Verification and Evaluation of Effectiveness

The effectiveness of implemented FSCAs is evaluated as part of the CAPA. As
soon as the CAPA is closed, a final report is sent to the responsible
authorities to verify that all actions taken are deemed sufficient for
completion.

All incident records shall be archived as part of the QMS.
