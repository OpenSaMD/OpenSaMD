## Mapping of Requirements

| Australian Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices) Regulations 2002 | Document Section |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Schedule 1                                                      | All              |

## Part 1: General Principles

### 1) Use of medical devices not to compromise health and safety

A medical device is to be designed and produced in a way that ensures that:

- (a) the device will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of a
  patient, or the safety and health of the user or any other person, when the
  device is used on a patient under the conditions and for the purposes for
  which the device was intended and, if applicable, by a user with appropriate
  technical knowledge, experience, education or training; and
- (b) any risks associated with the use of the device are:
  - (i) acceptable risks when weighed against the intended benefit to the
    patient; and
  - (ii) compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

### 2) Design and construction of medical devices to conform with safety principles

- (1) The solutions adopted by the manufacturer for the design and
  construction of a medical device must conform with safety principles, having
  regard to the generally acknowledged state of the art.
- (2) Without limiting subclause (1), in selecting appropriate solutions
  for the design and construction of a medical device so as to minimise any
  risks associated with the use of the device, the manufacturer must:

  - (a) first, identify hazards and associated risks arising from the use
    of the device for its intended purpose, and foreseeable misuse of the
    device; and
  - (b) second, eliminate, or reduce, these risks as far as possible by
    adopting a policy of inherently safe design and construction; and
  - (c) third, if appropriate, ensure that adequate protection measures are
    taken, including alarms if necessary, in relation to any risks that cannot
    be eliminated; and
  - (d) fourth, inform users of any residual risks that may arise due to
    any shortcomings of the protection measures adopted.

- (3) In paragraph (2)(d):
  - residual risk, for a medical device, means the risk remaining after the
    measures described in paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (c) have been applied.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

### 3) Medical devices to be suitable for intended purpose

A medical device must:

- (a) perform in the way intended by the manufacturer; and
- (b) be designed, produced and packaged in a way that ensures that it is
  suitable for one or more of the purposes mentioned in the definition of
  medical device in subsection 41BD(1) of the Act.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

### 4) Longâ€‘term safety

A medical device must be designed and produced in a way that ensures that if:

- (a) the device is used within the period, indicated by the manufacturer,
  in which the device can be safely used; and
- (b) the device is not subjected to stresses that are outside the stresses
  that can occur during normal conditions of use; and
- (c) the device is regularly maintained and calibrated in accordance with
  the manufacturer's instructions;

the characteristics and performances mentioned in clauses 1, 2 and 3 are not
adversely affected.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

### 5) Medical devices not to be adversely affected by transport or storage

A medical device must be designed, produced and packed in a way that ensures
that the characteristics and performance of the device when it is being used
for its intended purpose will not be adversely affected during transport and
storage that is carried out taking account of the instructions and information
provided by the manufacturer.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

### 6) Benefits of medical devices to outweigh any undesirable effects

The benefits to be gained from the use of a medical device for the performance
intended by the manufacturer must outweigh any undesirable effects arising from
its use.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

## Part 2: Principles about design and construction

### 7) Chemical, physical and biological properties

#### 7.1) Choice of materials

In ensuring that the requirements of Part 1 are met in relation to a medical
device, particular attention must be given to:

- (a) the chemical and physical properties of the materials used in the
  device; and
- (b) the compatibility between the materials used and biological tissues,
  cells, body fluids and specimens;

having regard to the intended purpose of the device.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

#### 7.2) Minimisation of risks associated with contaminants and residues

- (1) A medical device must be designed, produced and packed in a way that
  ensures that any risks associated with contaminants and residues that may
  affect a person who is involved in transporting, storing or using the device,
  or a patient, are minimised, having regard to the intended purpose of the
  device.
- (2) In minimising risks, particular consideration must be given to the
  likely duration and frequency of any tissue exposure associated with the
  transportation, storage or use of the device.

_Applicable:_ **TODO**

_Applicable Standard:_ **TODO**

_Evidence of Conformity:_

- **TODO**

#### 7.3) Ability to be used safely with materials etc

- (1) A medical device must be designed and produced in a way that ensures
  that the device can be used safely with any material, substance or gas with
  which the device may come into contact during normal use or use in routine
  procedures.
- (2) If the device is intended to be used to administer medicine, it must
  be designed and produced in a way that ensures that the device:
  - (a) is compatible with the provisions and restrictions applying to the
    medicine to be administered; and
  - (b) allows the medicine to perform as intended.
