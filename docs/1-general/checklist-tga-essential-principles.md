## Part 1: General Principles

### 1) Use of medical devices not to compromise health and safety

A medical device is to be designed and produced in a way that ensures that:

- **(a)** the device will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of a patient,
  or the safety and health of the user or any other person, when the device is
  used on a patient under the conditions and for the purposes for which the
  device was intended and, if applicable, by a user with appropriate technical
  knowledge, experience, education or training; and
- **(b)** any risks associated with the use of the device are:
  - **(i)** acceptable risks when weighed against the intended benefit to the patient;
    and
  - **(ii)** compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety.

### 2) Design and construction of medical devices to conform with safety principles

             (1)  The solutions adopted by the manufacturer for the design and construction of a medical device must conform with safety principles, having regard to the generally acknowledged state of the art.

             (2)  Without limiting subclause (1), in selecting appropriate solutions for the design and construction of a medical device so as to minimise any risks associated with the use of the device, the manufacturer must:

                     (a)  first, identify hazards and associated risks arising from the use of the device for its intended purpose, and foreseeable misuse of the device; and

                     (b)  second, eliminate, or reduce, these risks as far as possible by adopting a policy of inherently safe design and construction; and

                     (c)  third, if appropriate, ensure that adequate protection measures are taken, including alarms if necessary, in relation to any risks that cannot be eliminated; and

                     (d)  fourth, inform users of any residual risks that may arise due to any shortcomings of the protection measures adopted.

             (3)  In paragraph (2)(d):

residual risk, for a medical device, means the risk remaining after the measures described in paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (c) have been applied.
