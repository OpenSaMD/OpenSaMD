# OpenSaMD

Create an open source Software as a Medical Device platform that equips
entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, and researchers to take what they are building,
get it reviewed, tested, validated, regulated, and deployed for clinical use in
hospitals all around the world.

By having all of the platform, and all of the products be open source we can
all learn off of each other, stop reinventing the wheel, and focus on spending
more time taking our amazing innovations from our bench-top to the patient
bedside.

## Funding

OpenSaMD is a bootstrapped business that is entirely funded by the initial
founders, government grants, and the revenue generated from selling the
"for-clinical-use" versions of each of the products within the OpenSaMD
platform.

## Utilisation requirements

### Modifications

The OpenSaMD platform is distributed under the AGPL-3.0 license which requires
all modifications built on top of the platform or any of its products to also
be released under the same open source license.

In practice, this means, if you want to build on top of the OpenSaMD platform
you need to also distribute your resulting products under the AGPL-3.0 license.

### Clinical use

If you would like to use the OpenSaMD platform or any of its contained products
for clinical use you are required to purchase the regulated release. If you are
interested in purchasing the regulated release of an OpenSaMD product reach out
to [info@opensamd.com](mailto:info@opensamd.com).

The source code that is downloadable from GitHub or any release artifact that is not
built and distributed by OpenSaMD is explicitly **not** intended for clinical use.
