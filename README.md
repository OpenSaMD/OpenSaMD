# Regulatory

Creating a regulated Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) is hard. I personally
learn best through examples. There are some great examples available online
about how go about the regulatory requirements for a Software as a Medical
Device such as:

- https://openregulatory.com/blueprint-certifying-medical-software/
- https://github.com/innolitics/rdm

However, I could not find an example GitHub repo that provides the end-to-end
documentation for a real Medical Device including its associated Quality
Management System and Technical Documentation.

I am embarking on building a SaMD which is classified as exempt clinical
decision support software within Australia. I am seriously considering
undergoing all of the regulatory work within this open access repository and
making all of the regulatory documents within this repository available for
everyone to use and adapt for their own purposes under a [CC BY 4.0
license](https://github.com/RadiotherapyAI/regulatory/blob/main/LICENSE).

My hope of doing it this way is that others coming after me won't have such a
hard task set out for them to create a compliant SaMD. And also, that by making
Radiotherapy AI's regulatory work be undergone completely out in the open it
might enable to Radiotherapy AI to itself become the best version of itself
through radical transparency:

> ... all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for
> everything that becomes visible is light -- [Ephesians
> 5:13](https://www.biblewebapp.com/study/?v1=EP5_13)

Please note, that this is a work in progress repository. I am just learning the
ropes of everything that is required. There will be mistakes. If you find them,
please let me know, and if you'd also like to help other SaMD developers into
the future, and you have other resources that might be beneficial here, please
let me know.

I still haven't fully decided whether or not this is the right way to go. I
potentially could be missing something that makes this approach unreasonable.
There may also be cases where certain reports really do need to be kept
private. I suspect though that those reports can still have references within
this public repository, and a separate private repository can be maintained to
hold those documents under those exceptional circumstances.
