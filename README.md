# Radiotherapy AI's public regulatory documentation

To see the web-rendered version of this regulatory documentation go to
https://docs.radiotherapy.ai.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. Right now I am just learning the ropes while
putting all of my warts up here for all to see. There will be mistakes. If you
find them please let me know. Also, if you want to help out, please get in

## Why create this out in the open?

Creating a regulated Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) is hard. I personally
learn best through examples. There are some great examples available online
about how go about the regulatory requirements for a SaMD such as:

- https://openregulatory.com/blueprint-certifying-medical-software/
- https://github.com/innolitics/rdm
- https://www.tidepool.org/regulatory

However, I could not find an example GitHub repo that provides the end-to-end
documentation for a real SaMD including its associated Quality Management
System and Technical Documentation. I couldn't find a nice example that would
allow me to copy and follow.

Let's all stop re-inventing the wheel when it comes to SaMD regulation. Let's
undergo our Medical Device regulation out in the open so that at the end of the
day the regulatory process is easier to understand, easier to fulfil, and
hopefully we can more effectively make better products that help our patients.
