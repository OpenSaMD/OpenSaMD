<blockquote>
<div><p>Disclaimer: this privacy statement refers to websites in the following context:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your website does not typically require visitors to enter personal data in order to user its services.</p></li>
<li><p>No particular “legitimate interests” (section 10)</p></li>
<li><p>No automated decision-making (section 14)</p></li>
<li><p>Particular website features: newsletter incl. tracking (if, for example, your website uses Google
Analytics, you should consider a separate sub-section for this)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s painful - but you will have to go through the entire text and adjust it to your own company website
where necessary. We hope this template still hopes you with a general structure.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Data Subjects Pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation</p>
<p>Data protection is a particularly high priority for the management of &lt;enter company name&gt;. The use of the
website of &lt;enter company name&gt; is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data
subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become
necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such
processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data
subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
country-specific data protection regulations applicable to &lt;enter company name&gt;. By means of this data
protection declaration, our company would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this
data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>As the controller, &lt;enter company name&gt; has implemented technical and organizational measures to ensure the
most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, internet-based data
transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
<section id="definitions">
<h2>1. Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The data protection declaration of &lt;enter company name&gt; is based on the terms used by the European
legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration
should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business
partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>
<p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>a) Personal data</strong> Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>b) Data subject</strong> Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is
processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>c) Processing</strong> Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on
sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation,
structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>d) Restriction of processing</strong> Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the
aim of limiting their processing in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>e) Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or
predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>f) Pseudonymization</strong> Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and
organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable
natural person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</strong> Controller or controller responsible for the
processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and
means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>h) Processor</strong> Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which
processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>i) Recipient</strong> Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which
the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive
personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall
not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in
compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.</p></li>

<h2>3. Collection of general data and information<a class="headerlink" href="#collection-of-general-data-and-information" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The website of &lt;enter company name&gt; collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or
automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log
files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the
accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers),
(4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address
(IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>
<p>When using this general data and information, &lt;enter company name&gt; does not draw any conclusions about the
data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2)
optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our
information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the
information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, &lt;enter company name&gt;
analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data
protection and data security of our company, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal
data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data
provided by a data subject.</p>

<section id="subscription-to-our-newsletters">
<h2>4. Subscription to our newsletters<a class="headerlink" href="#subscription-to-our-newsletters" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>On the website, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask
used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered
from the controller.</p>
<p>&lt;enter company name&gt; informs its customers and business partners regularly by the means of a newsletter
about company offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data
subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A
confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for
newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to
prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>
<p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by
the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as
the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the
(possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of
the legal protection of the controller.</p>
<p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our
newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary
for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the
event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There
will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to
our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data,
which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of
revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe
from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the
controller in a different way.</p>
</section>
<section id="newsletter-tracking">
<h2>5. Newsletter-Tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#newsletter-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Our newsletter contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such
e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical
analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel,
&lt;enter company name&gt; may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the
e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>
<p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by
the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future
newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to
third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent
issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the
controller. &lt;enter company name&gt; automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a
revocation.</p>

<h2>7. Rights of the data subject<a class="headerlink" href="#rights-of-the-data-subject" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>a) Right of confirmation (Art. 15 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him
or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or

<li><p><strong>b) Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time
and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject
access to the following information:</p>
<ul>

criteria used to determine that period;</p></li>
<li><p>the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or
restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing;</p></li>
<li><p>the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;</p></li>
<li><p>where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their
source;</p></li>
<li><p>the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of
the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the
significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are
transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject
shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. If a data
subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of
the controller.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>c) Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data
concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the
right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary
statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time,
contact any employee of the controller.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten, Art. 17 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted
by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her
without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay
where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or
otherwise processed.</p></li>
<li><p>The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article
6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for
the processing.</p></li>
<li><p>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no
overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant
to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.</p></li>
<li><p>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</p></li>
<li><p>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to
which the controller is subject.</p></li>
<li><p>The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred
to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal
data stored by &lt;enter company name&gt;, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
controller. An employee of &lt;enter company name&gt; shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied
with immediately. Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article
17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of
implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers
processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links
to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of
&lt;enter company name&gt; will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>e) Right of restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by
the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following
applies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller
to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</p></li>
<li><p>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests
instead the restriction of their use instead.</p></li>
<li><p>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required
by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p></li>
<li><p>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification
whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the
processing of personal data stored by us, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the
controller. The employee of &lt;enter company name&gt; will arrange the restriction of the processing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>f) Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller,
in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those
data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been
provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or
point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR,
and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
the controller. Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of
the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one
controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and
freedoms of others. In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time
contact any employee of &lt;enter company name&gt;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>g) Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of
personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This
also applies to profiling based on these provisions. &lt;enter company name&gt; shall no longer process the
personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment,
exercise or defence of legal claims. If we processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data
subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for
such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the
data subject objects to the processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the personal
data for these purposes. In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her
particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her for scientific or
historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. In order
to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of &lt;enter company name&gt;. In
addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and
notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical
specifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</strong> Each data subject shall have the right
granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing,
including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects
him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a
contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State
law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data
subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit
consent. If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the
data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit consent, &lt;enter
company name&gt; shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and
legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to
express his or her point of view and contest the decision. If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights
concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of &lt;enter
company name&gt;.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent</strong> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time. If
the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact
any employee of &lt;enter company name&gt;.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also contact a supervisory authority with a complaint at any time, e.g. the supervisory authority of
the state of your residence or the authority that oversees &lt;enter company name&gt;.</p>

<h2>8. Data protection for applications and the application procedures<a class="headerlink" href="#data-protection-for-applications-and-the-application-procedures" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The data controller shall collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the
processing of the application procedure. The processing may also be carried out electronically. This is the
case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or by means of a
web form on the website to the controller. If the data controller concludes an employment contract with an
applicant, the submitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in
compliance with legal requirements. If no employment contract is concluded with the applicant by the
controller, the <em>application documents shall be automatically erased six months after notification of the
refusal decision</em>, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller are opposed to the
erasure. Other legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g. a burden of proof in a procedure under the
General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).</p>

<section id="legal-basis-for-the-processing">
<h2>9. Legal basis for the processing<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-basis-for-the-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a
specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract
to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for
the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The
same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for
example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal
obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations,
the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be
necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the
case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other
vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing
would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f
GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned
legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company
or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are
particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He
considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller
(Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>

<p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry
out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>

<h2>11. Period for which the personal data will be stored<a class="headerlink" href="#period-for-which-the-personal-data-will-be-stored" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention
period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no
longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>

<p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also
result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be
necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently
be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our
company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence
that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data
subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the
provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the
contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of
data.</p>
