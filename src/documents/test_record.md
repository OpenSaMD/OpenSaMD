title: Software Test Record

# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to record the status of the software tests run for {{device.name}}.

# Scope

The scope of this document is the software system within the {{device.name}} product.

# Verification

I, FULL DEVELOPER NAME, verify that the results recorded here are complete and accurate [[62304:9.8.g]].

TODO: document the identity of the tester if any manual steps were required.

Tests were performed on DATE TESTS COMPLETED.
TODO: document the date tested [[62304:9.8.f]]

The tests meet our specified pass fail criteria (see Test Plan section of the Software Plan).

# Test Environment

TODO: Describe the test environment. This section should include all of the information necessary for someone to reproduce the tests. For example, it could be wise to include a list of all the environment variables, installed system packages and versions, the git hash, hardware used, etc. It should also include any relevant testing tools [[62304:5.1.11]].
TODO: document the software version tested [[62304:9.8.c]]
TODO: document any relevant configuration [[62304:9.8.d]]
TODO: document the relevant tools used to run these tests [[62304:9.8.e]]

# Test Results

[[These are the results of automated unit and integration testing as well as manual testing 62304:9.8.a]]
TODO: List of all the tests, split into sections by type. You can use the three subsections below as a starting point.

TODO: List any problems that were found during testing, and, if relevant, the problem report ids.
TODO: document any anomilies encountered [[62304:9.8.b]]

It is ok if some tests do not trace to any particular requirements, however all requirements must be covered by some tests (if they are not, add tests).

## Unit Tests

| Test Name | Test Status | Requirement IDs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
{% for test_name in unit_test_record -%}
| {{test_name}} | {{unit_test_record[test_name].result}} | {{unit_test_record[test_name].req_ids}} | {% if unit_test_record[test_name].note is defined %}{{unit_test_record[test_name].note}}{% endif %} |
{% endfor %}

## Integration Tests

| Test Name | Test Status | Requirement IDs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

{% endfor %}

## Manual Tests

| Test Name | Step | Test Status | Requirement IDs | Notes |
