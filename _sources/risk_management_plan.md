# Risk Management Plan

TODO: This document is currently in-progress, and as such, it is not
comprehensive. Note that it currently conflicts slightly with the risk-related
activities in the software plan. These issues will be rectified in a future RDM
update.

## Purpose

This risk management plan describes the activites that are performed in order to
identify hazards and hazardous situations, estimate and evaluate the associated
risks, control these risks, and monitor the effectiveness of the risk control
measures. These steps will be performed throughout the life cycle of the medical
device.

This risk management plan is intended to fulfill the requirements of ISO
14971:2019.

## Risk Evaluation and Criteria for Risk Acceptability

Risk evaluation is quantified according to the Risk Acceptability Matrix:

| |  Extremely Low |  Low |  Medium |  High |  Extremely High | 
| -- |  -- |  -- |  -- |  -- |  -- | 
| Negligible |  Low | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| Minor |  Low | Low | Low | Low | Medium |
| Serious |  Low | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Critical |  Low | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Catastrophic |  Low | Medium | Medium | High | High |


Risk probability levels are defined as follows:

| Risk Probability Label | Definition |
| --                     | --         |
| Extremely Low | Extremely unlikely |
| Low | Unlikely |
| Medium | Somewhat likely |
| High | Likely |
| Extremely High | Extremely likely |


Risk severity levels are defined as follows:

| Risk Severity Label | Definition |
| --                     | --         |
| Negligible | Inconvenience or temporary discomfort |
| Minor | Results in temporary injury or impairment not requiring professional medical intervention |
| Serious | Results in injury or impairment requiring professional medical intervention |
| Critical | Results in permanent impairment or life-threatening injury |
| Catastrophic | Results in patient death |


Finally, risk acceptability levels are defined according to the following
criteria:

| Risk Level | Acceptance Criteria |
| --                     | --         |
| Low | Acceptable |
| Medium | Investigate further risk reduction. Should be reduced as low as reasonably practicable. |
| High | Unacceptable. Further risk mitigations are required. |
