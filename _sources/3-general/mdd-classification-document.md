**1.2 Invasive Devices**

| Definition | Applicable |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| **Invasive device**<br>A device which, in whole or in part, penetrates inside the body, either through a body orifice or through the surface of the body.<br>**Body orifice**<br>Any natural opening in the body, as well as the external surface of the eyeball, or any permanent artificial opening, such as a stoma.<br>**Surgically invasive device**<br>An invasive device which penetrates inside the body through the surface of the body, with the aid or in the context of a surgical operation. For the purposes of this Directive devices other than those referred to in the previous subparagraph and which produce penetration other than through an established body orifice, shall be treated as surgically invasive devices.<br>**Implantable device**<br>Any device which is intended:<br>— to be totally introduced into the human body or,<br>— to replace an epithelial surface or the surface of the eye, by surgical intervention which is intended to remain in place after the procedure.<br><br>Any device intended to be partially introduced into the human body through surgical intervention and intended to remain in place after the procedure for at least 30 days is also considered an implantable device. | No |

**1.4 Active Medical Device**

| Definition | Applicable |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Any medical device operation of which depends on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity and which acts by converting this energy. Medical devices intended to transmit energy, substances or other elements between an active medical device and the patient, without any significant change, are not considered to be active medical devices.<br>Stand alone software is considered to be an active medical device. | Yes |

**1.5 Active Therapeutical Device**

| Definition | Applicable |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Any active medical device, whether used alone or in combination with other medical devices, to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures with a view to treatment or alleviation of an illness, injury or handicap. |  |

**1.6 Active Device for Diagnosis**

| Definition | Applicable |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Any active medical device, whether used alone or in combination with other medical devices, to supply information for detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating physiological conditions, states of health, illnesses or congenital deformities. |  |

**1.7 Central Circulatory System**

## Chapter 2: Implementing Rules

| Rules | Applicable |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 2.1: Application of the classification rules shall be governed by the intended purpose of the devices. | Yes |
| 2.2: If the device is intended to be used in combination with another device, the classification rules shall apply separately to each of the devices. Accessories are classified in their own right separately from the device with which they are used. |  |
| 2.3: Software, which drives a device or influences the use of a device, falls automatically in the same class. |  |
| 2.4: If the device is not intended to be used solely or principally in a specific part of the body, it must be considered and classified on the basis of the most critical specified use. |  |
| 2.5: If several rules apply to the same device, based on the performance specified for the device by the manufacturer, the strictest rules resulting in the higher classification shall apply. |  |
| 2.6: In calculating the duration referred to in Section 1.1 of Chapter I, continuous use means ‘an uninterrupted actual use of the device for the intended purpose’. However where usage of a device is discontinued in order for the device to be replaced immediately by the same or an identical device this shall be considered an extension of the continuous use of the device. |  |
