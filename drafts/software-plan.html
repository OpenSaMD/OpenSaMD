<p>This document for Radiotherapy AI Pty Ltd plans how the software in
Radiotherapy AI Contour Recommendations will be designed, developed, and maintained. It identifies the
deliverables, tasks, roles and responsibilities involved in these processes.</p>
<p>All software items in Radiotherapy AI Contour Recommendations are assigned a Class A software-safety
class, which means no injury or damage to health could occur if the software
fails [[62304:4.3.a]]. See RISK MANAGEMENT FILE for details.</p>
<p>[[Although it would be possible to assign different safety classifications to
different software items, to keep the process simple, we simply assign the same
classification to all of them. This classification fulfils 62304:4.3.b,
62304:4.3.c, 62304:4.3.d, 62304:4.3.e, 62304:4.3.f, 62304:4.3.g, and

<h3>Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>[[:Most of these definitions are very similar to IEC62304:2006+A1:2015’s definitions. However, they have been modified as appropriate for a better understanding by software engineers.]]</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> – A set of one or more interrelated or interacting tasks. An activity has an input, an output, and verification tasks. Records of activity outputs must be available in case of an audit.</p>
<p><strong>Change Request</strong> – A documented specification of a change to be made to the software system.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration Item</strong> – An entity (e.g., compiler, software library, source code file, markdown document, Docker image, etc.) that can be uniquely identified using a particular version or Git hash.</p>
<p><strong>Harm</strong> – The physical injury or damage of health of people (patients or users), or damage to property or the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Hazard</strong> – A potential source of harm.</p>
<p><strong>Hazardous Situation</strong> – A circumstance in which people, property, or the environment is exposed to one or more hazard(s). Not every hazardous situation leads to harm.
Software is not itself a hazard because it can not directly cause harm, but software can contribute towards producing hazardous situations.</p>
<p><strong>Known Anomaly</strong> – A problem report that we do not plan on addressing.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Report</strong> – A record of actual or potential behavior of a software product that a user or other interested person believes to be unsafe, inappropriate for the intended use, or contrary to specification.</p>
<p><strong>Public Release</strong> – A <em>release</em> that is made available to medical device users.</p>
<p><strong>Record</strong> – A special type of document that states the results achieved or provides evidence that activities were performed. Unlike other documents—such as this software plan—records are not usually revised after being approved.</p>
<p><strong>Release</strong> – A version of the software system which may or may not be ready to be made publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> – The combination of the probability of harm and the severity of that harm.</p>
<p><strong>SOUP</strong> – <strong>Software of unknown provenance</strong>, also known as “off-the-shelf software”, is a <strong>software item</strong> that has not been developed for the purpose of being incorporated into the medical device and for which adequate records of the development processes are not available. Most software dependencies are SOUP, and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong> – Freedom from unacceptable risk. Note that it does not mean that there is no risk, as that is impossible. The perception of risk can depend greatly on cultural, socio-economic, and educational background, the actual and perceived state of health of the patient, and whether the hazard was avoidable.
Our obligation as medical device software developers is to develop safe devices while also balancing economic constraints. A device that is never reaches the market can’t help patients.</p>
<p><strong>Software Item</strong> – A module within the software system which may further decomposed into smaller software items. The <strong>software system</strong> is itself a software item, and thus the software items for a hierarchy. See the software design specification for a description of how the software system is decomposed into smaller software items.</p>
<p><strong>Software Requirement</strong> – A particular function that the software must support or some other constraint that the software must fulfill. Requirements describe the <em>what</em>, while specifications and designs describe the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Software System</strong> – All of the software in the project. The software system is decomposed into <strong>software items</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Software Unit</strong> – A software item that is not further subdivided.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong> – The smallest piece of work that needs to be done.</p>

<h3>Development Life Cycle Model<a class="headerlink" href="#development-life-cycle-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Radiotherapy AI Contour Recommendations will be developed using an agile software development life-cycle model inspired by <em>AAMI TIR45: 2012/(R)2018, “Guidance on the use of AGILE practices in the development of medical device software”</em> [[by “agile” we mean a combined evolutionary and incremental life-cycle model]]. Activities occur in four layers:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Project</p></li>
<li><p>Release</p></li>
<li><p>Sprint</p></li>
<li><p>Issue</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Project-layer activities govern the entire project. Release-layer activities govern a particular release. A project consists of one or more releases. Some releases may be for internal purposes, while others are publicly available. Releases are organized using GitLab milestones. The sprint layer is used to organize releases into smaller sets of work. Sprints are organized by assigning software engineers to GitLab issues during <a class="reference external" href="#sprint---planning">Sprint Planning Meetings</a>. Issue-layer activities govern a small piece of functionality or a problem report. Issues are organized using GitLab issues.</p>
<p>Activity inputs and outputs need not be in a consistent state in-between public releases, but all activity outputs must be consistent and verified for each public release during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---final-verification">Release - Final Verification activity</a>. See Figure 1 for a diagram that includes the four layers, activities, and their outputs.</p>

<h3>Documentation Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation-plan" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regulatory documents are stored, reviewed, and modified in the git repository, often alongside code changes [[62304:5.1.8.d]]. Here are the document deliverables that are produced for each release:</p>
<p>The <strong>Level of Concern</strong> document is written by the project lead based on the RISK MANAGEMENT FILE. It is reviewed by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---final-verification">Release Verification activity</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Software Requirements Specification</strong>, or <strong>SRS</strong>, describes what the software needs to accomplish. A first draft is written by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#project---initial-requirements-analysis">Initial Requirements Analysis activity</a>, and is finalized by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---final-verification">Release Verification activity</a>. Software engineers may clarify and extend the document during <a class="reference external" href="#issue---requirements-analysis">Issue Implementation</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Software Design Specification</strong>, or <strong>SDS</strong>, describes how the software meets the requirements in the SRS. A first draft is written by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#project---initial-architectual-design">Initial Architectural Design activity</a>. Software engineers extend and improve it during <a class="reference external" href="#issue---design-specifications">Issue Implementation</a>. It is reviewed for consistency by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---final-verification">Release Verification activity</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>Software Description</strong> and <strong>Software Architecture Chart</strong> documents, which are requested in the FDA’s 2005 “Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices”, are both included as sections in the SDS.</p>
<p>The <strong>Release History</strong> record includes a list of change requests and problem reports addressed within a particular release. It also records all of the implemented changes and their verification via code reviews in the release. Finally, it lists all known anomalies present in the release. This document is generated from records extracted from GitLab merge requests and issues that are created during several activities, but most especially the <a class="reference external" href="#issue---merge-request-review">Merge Request Review activity</a>. The document is reviewed by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---final-verification">Release Verification activity</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Test Record</strong> describes a set of tests which were run, when, and by who. It also must include enough details to reproduce the testing setup. It is produced during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---software-system-testing">Software System Testing activity</a>. There will be at least one such record produced for each release.</p>
<p>The <strong>Release Record</strong> records the verifications steps performed by the project lead during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---final-verification">Release Verification activity</a>.</p>

<h3>Project - Planning and Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#project-planning-and-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Start of a new project</p>
<p><strong>Performed by:</strong> Project Lead</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> User needs and system requirements</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>GitLab Repository Setup</strong></p>
<p>Set up a git repository on GitLab.</p>
<p>Configure GitLab to disable <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt--f">forced pushes</a>. This ensures users can’t overwrite the project history.</p>
<p>Configure GitLab to only accept <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">signed commits</a>. Signed commits ensure that code changes can be traced back to the person who made the changes.</p>
<p>Configure GitLab to require merge-request reviews as appropriate. Consider using the CODEOWNERS file to ensure the proper reviewers review changes to particular files. E.g., perhaps the project lead will be the code owner of the software plan.</p>
<p>Create the following issue labels:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bug</p></li>
<li><p>External-Review</p></li>
<li><p>Obsolete</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create a GitLab milestone that is named “icebox”. This milestone will be used to tag issues that may be included in future releases.</p>
<p>Consider adding a GitLab issue template to enforce the format for problem reports. See <a class="reference external" href="#issue---problem-resolution">Issue - Problem Resolution</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Initialize Regulatory Documents</strong></p>
<p>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/innolitics/rdm">RDM</a> and its dependencies. Initialize the regulatory templates using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rdm</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code> command.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Configure RDM</strong></p>
<p>Edit the default values in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config.yml</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data/device.yml</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data/workflow.yml</span></code> as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Refine Software Plan</strong></p>
<p>Read through this software plan and modify it as appropriate. Use the audit notes to refer back to IEC62304:2006+A1:2015 to ensure your modifications are compliant.</p>
<p>Search through this document for the text “TODO”. Follow the instructions next to the “TODO” notes and delete the instructions once they’re addressed.</p>

<li><p><strong>TODOs</strong></p>
<p>Ensure all the outstanding TODOs in the software plan have been addressed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gap Audit</strong></p>
<p>Compile the release version of the markdown documents (e.g., by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code>). Then run a gap audit to help ensure you’re complying with IEC62304:2006+A1:2015. For example, you may run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rdm</span> <span class="pre">gap</span> <span class="pre">62304_2015_class_b</span> <span class="pre">release/*.md</span></code>. Address any gaps.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Proof-Read Plan</strong></p>
<p>Read through the software plan. Fix any typos. Correct any outdated information. Check that all the links work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Activity Specification</strong></p>
<p>Ensure each activity specification includes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the activity’s trigger events</p></li>
<li><p>which roles should perform the activity</p></li>
<li><p>its inputs</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p>Keep this planning document up to date as the project commences [[62304:5.1.2]], and step through the verification tasks whenever there are process changes.</p>
<p>All software activity outputs will be stored in this git repository, the associated GitLab issues, or the associated GitLab merge requests, unless explicitly noted otherwise [[62304:5.1.1.b]]. Problem reports and change requests are stored as GitLab issues. A GitLab issue tagged with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bug</span></code> label is a problem report. If a problem report outlines a set of requested changes, then it can simultaneously act as a change request. GitLab issues tagged with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">obsolete</span></code> label are ignored.</p>
<p>The software engineers working on the project are responsible for keeping all software activity outputs within version control at the times specified in the activity descriptions [[62304:5.1.9.c, 62304:5.1.9.d, and 62304:5.1.9.e]].</p>
<p>Also, document how the software can be reliably delivered to the point of use without corruption or unauthorized change [[62304:5.8.8]].</p>

<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> User needs and requirements</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Write Change Request</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to divide requirements into change requests. Change requests that will be implemented in upcoming sprints should usually be made more granular, while change requests that may not be worked on for a while can be less granular.</p>
<p>Since change requests may be split up later and detailed requirements are added in an agile fashion, this activity allows minimal detail to be added to the change request. Sometimes even a title is sufficient.</p>
<p>Unless you’re the project lead, don’t assign the issue to a release. That will be handled during sprint planning. If, however, you know that the issue won’t be tackled in any of the current releases, feel free to add it to the icebox GitLab milestone.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Start a New Release Record</strong></p>
<p>Make a copy of the Release Record and Test Record templates and fill in as much detail as is appropriate; these will be filled in before the release is finalized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Review Software Dependencies</strong></p>
<p>If the release is public, determine if any software dependencies have become obsolete or should be upgraded. Also, review known anomalies in published anomalies lists as appropriate [[62304:6.1.f]].</p>
<p>Create change requests as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Review Problem Reports</strong></p>
<p>Consider outstanding problem reports in the backlog [[62304:9.4]]. Move problem reports into the current release as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Review Trends in Problem Reports</strong></p>
<p>You may skip this task for the first public release.</p>
<p>Look through historical problem reports and attempt to identify any adverse trends. For example, some software items may have many problem reports associated with them [[62304:9.6 and 14971:9.a]] or may have new or revised standards [[14971:9.b]]. Also, review past trends that were addressed in previous releases, as appropriate, and confirm the trends have been reversed [[62304:9.7.b]].</p>
<p>Create change requests as appropriate.</p>

<p>Feedback and complaints are gathered and stored in USER FEEDBACK. This information should incorporated into release planning [[14971:9, 14971:3.4.f, 62304:6.1.a, 62304:6.1.b and 62304:6.2.1.1]].</p>
<p>[[:This activity addresses 62304:6.3.1 since change requests resulting from maintenance and problem resolution are processed in the same manner in which risk control measures and feature change requests. Note that some releases are not public. The feedback collection activities are not included here because it is assumed that other processes will handle this. We also do not go into detail here regarding what criteria should be used to determine whether the feedback is considered a problem. Thus 62304:6.1.b, 62304:6.2.1.2, 62304:9.1.a, 62304:9.1.b, and 62304:9.1.c are handled elsewhere.]]</p>

<h3>Sprint - Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#sprint-planning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Usually every two weeks</p>
<p><strong>Performed by:</strong> Engineering team during a call</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The list of change requests and work accomplished during the last week</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>GitLab Setup</strong></p>
<p>Create a GitLab epic with an appropriate name, start date, and end date. This will be used to track which issues are going to be worked on in the current sprint.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrations</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the meeting, each engineer presents a live demonstration of their progress. These demos allow the product owner to identify gaps, misunderstandings, or inconsistencies in the requirements. (Architectural design, construction, testing, etc., can better be reviewed in merge requests).</p>
<p>Keep the demonstrations short and appropriately high-level for their purpose. Prepare beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assignments for Next Sprint</strong></p>
<p>Once the demonstrations are complete, move on to the second part of the call.</p>
<p>Start by closing any change requests that are completed, as determined by the product owner.</p>
<p>Next, review new change requests and problem reports that have been added since the last sprint meeting. Assign the issues to the appropriate release or delete them.</p>
<p>Change requests that have not yet been assigned to a release have not yet been approved, and thus any work that implements these change requests should not be merged into main [[62304:8.2.1 and 62304:6.2.4]]. Being assigned to the current release means the product owner approves of the work.</p>
<p>Finally, assign change requests to be completed by each engineer during the following sprint. Add these change requests to the GitLab epic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Process Retrospective</strong></p>
<p>Finally, ask if there are any opportunities for process improvement. Typically there isn’t much time left to discuss in detail, so if large changes are proposed, it can be helpful to schedule a follow-up call.</p>
<p>Once a process change has been agreed upon, the project lead should update the software plan to reflect the new process.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Closed change requests, change request approvals, change request assignments for the following sprint</p>
<p><strong>Verified by:</strong> Not applicable</p>
<p><strong>Verification tasks:</strong> Not applicable</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical that the product owner be present during most sprint planning meetings since they’re in the best position to review requirements and approve new change requests.</p>

<h3>Issue - Creating Merge Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-creating-merge-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Need to change documentation, code, or other files</p>
<p><strong>Performed by:</strong> Whoever is making the change</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Varies depending on the change</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Identify Change Request</strong></p>
<p>All changes must tie back to a change request [[62304:8.2.1]]. Therefore, there should be a change request before you begin work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create Git Branch</strong></p>
<p>Create a new git branch. The name should begin with the change request number, e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">104-short-description</span></code>. If you are working on multiple change requests at once, you can include both numbers in the name, e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">104-132-short-description</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create Git Commits</strong></p>
<p>Create git commits of logically related sets of changes as you make progress [[62304:5.1.1.d, 62304:6.1.e and 62304:8.2.2]]. Write commit messages with varying levels of detail, as appropriate. Typically, early on in a project, when many changes are made quickly, thorough git commit messages are less worthwhile. As the project stabilizes (and especially after the first public release), commit messages become more important.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines for writing commit messages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Separate subject from body with a blank line</p></li>
<li><p>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</p></li>
<li><p>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</p></li>
<li><p>Capitalize the subject line</p></li>
<li><p>Do not end the subject line with a period</p></li>
<li><p>Wrap the body at 72 characters</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All commits should include a link back to the change request. E.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Issue</span> <span class="pre">#104</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rdm</span> <span class="pre">hooks</span></code> command, which may have been set up as part of the onboarding activity, uses the numbers in the git branch name to pre-populate these. However, if you’re working on another change request within your current branch, that’s okay—just be sure to update the numbers.</p>
<p>Push your commits to GitLab periodically to back up your work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Create Merge Request</strong></p>
<p>When work on the change request(s) is nearing completion, a GitLab merge request should be created for merging your git branch into the main branch. A brief summary of the changes should be included in the merge request description. These comments will be included in the release history record.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assign Merge Request Reviewer</strong></p>
<p>Once you’re ready for your changes to be reviewed, you must assign a reviewer to verify the changes. Select a reviewer (or multiple reviewers) as appropriate for the activities you performed. Each activity indicates who must verify the outputs. E.g., some activities require that the project lead be the reviewer.</p>
<p>Occasionally, due to the absence of other reviewers or due to an internal testing deadline, it may be necessary to skip the merge request review. When this happens, the engineer should justify why a review wasn’t necessary within the merge request comments or create a change request or a “TODO” to ensure verification occurs before the next release.</p>
<p>If, as is occasionally appropriate, someone outside of the core development team reviews a merge request, then mention who performed the review in the merge request body and tag the merge request with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">external-review</span></code> label.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Addressing Comments</strong></p>
<p>It’s rarely acceptable to ignore comments entirely. This is disheartening to the reviewer. If you disagree with a suggestion, then make your case. If you think a refactor would make the code better but isn’t necessary, then make your case.</p>
<p>Once an issue is resolved, it’s best to “thumbs up” or write “fixed” in the comment that requested the change. Why is fixing the issue and pushing the change insufficient? Sometimes there is a mismatch between what the reviewer thinks is being suggested and what the author does to address the suggestion. In this situations one person may think they’ve addressed an issue while another person hasn’t.</p>
<p>If the merge request wasn’t approved, request a new review once the comments have been addressed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Merging the Request</strong></p>
<p>Merge the merge request into the main branch, resolving any conflicts that arise. Once the branch has been merged successfully, delete the branch in GitLab [[62304:5.1.5 and 62304:5.6.1]].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Changes merged into the main branch</p>
<p><strong>Verified by:</strong> Depends on the changes</p>
<p><strong>Verification tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Merge Request Message</strong></p>
<p>Verify that the merge request’s message describes the changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Git Commit Messages Include Change Request Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Verify that all of the git commit messages include change request numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Git Commit Message Content</strong></p>
<p>Verify that the git commit messages are appropriate (see comments above).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p>This activity discusses the generic tasks involved with making <em>any</em> changes to the documents, code, or other files in the Radiotherapy AI Contour Recommendations repository. Depending on the changes being made, details from other activities will also apply.</p>

<p>Using the merge request description and the content of the changes, determine which activities were performed and which were performed partially or completely. If it’s unclear, ask the merge-request author for clarification.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Determine Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>Determine whether you’re an appropriate person to perform the verification. For example, if you’re verifying outputs for an activity that specifies the project lead should perform the verification, and you’re not the project lead, then request that the project lead perform the review.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re reviewing code that can lead to severe patient harm and you aren’t unfamiliar with the code or don’t have enough time to perform a necessarily thorough review, then request that someone else perform the review.</p>

<p>Most git hosts have features that let you save standard replies. We suggest using these.</p>
<p>It’s okay to skip some common and low-risk verification tasks in this list. For example, there’s no need to note that the “Git Commit Messages Include Change Request Numbers” verification task was performed for each commit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Write Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Write detailed feedback. Ask questions before making suggestions. Compliment good work!</p>
<p>One purpose of code reviews is to improve the team. and improving the team, while less direct, is often the most efficient way to improve the code and device’s safety. Many medical-device software projects extend over years; small improvements to the team can make a big impact. Thus, reviews should be partially about training. This is especially true when the reviewer is much more experienced with an activity than the author, but occasional in-depth conversations among equals can improve the team.</p>
<p>In addition to seniors teaching juniors and equals teaching each other, juniors can also learn by reviewing a senior’s code and asking questions. If you think the main purpose of reviewing code is to improve the code, then a junior engineer reviewing their senior may not feel the need to do in-depth reviews. This is not the case. You should ask questions about the code you don’t understand.</p>
<p>If comments will be useful long after the review, consider suggesting that they be added to the documentation or code comments.</p>
<p>You don’t always need to leave comments. Sometimes there is nothing to say. It can be helpful to distinguish the case where you were too busy to do an in-depth review from an in-depth review that didn’t result in any comments. In the latter case, it’s helpful to comment on what you reviewed and any questions you asked yourself.</p>
<p>If you’re surprised by a change, ask the author why they did something a certain way. Sometimes there’s a good reason you hadn’t thought of, but even when there isn’t, a Socrates-style sequence of questions can teach better than dictates. On the other hand, there’s not always time for dialectic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sign Off</strong></p>
<p>If you’re satisfied with the changes, approve the merge request [[62304:8.2.4.c]]. If there are important changes that must be made before the code can be merged, indicate this.</p>
<p>Often the activity outputs will be incomplete. This often occurs since we’re using an agile methodology. All activity outputs will be reviewed during the final release verification activity. However, if there are incomplete activity outputs, be sure they’re recorded either as “TODO” comments within the repository or as new change requests within the current release.</p>
<p>If the suggested changes are low-risk, it’s okay to approve the merge request before the author implements them. This avoids another round-trip of approvals for a small change.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p>Note that these tasks do not need to be performed in the order they’re presented. Often the design emerges during code constructions. Also, gaps in the requirements may not be clear until you begin coding. However, for bigger issues, it’s usually best to document the requirements and design first. We also recommend writing some tests first, or at least plan how you will write them first, since doing so often leads to better designs.</p>

<h3>Issue - Requirements Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-requirements-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Adding or planning for new features with undocumented or changed requirements</p>
<p><strong>Performed by:</strong> Engineer implementing, or planning for, the change</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Vague or partially specified requirements in the change request or knowledge of the user needs</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Is it necessary to write any new requirements [[62304:5.2.5]]?</p>
<p>Writing software requirements is an art and a science; one must find a balance between precision and utility. If you’re writing a set of requirements and it feels like a waste of time, some of them may not be necessary, or they may be too detailed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Write the Software Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Add the requirements to SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SOFTWARE.</p>
<p>The distinction between software requirements and design specifications can be challenging.</p>
<p>Requirements should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>not imply solution</p></li>
<li><p>be verifiable</p></li>
<li><p>be short, ideally one sentence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Design specifications, on the other hand, should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>be one of, possibly, many solutions</p></li>
<li><p>be detailed.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tie to System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>This project, being software as a medical device, has no system requirements [[62304:5.1.3.a 62304:5.1.3.b 62304:5.2.6.a 62304:5.2.6.f]].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Updates to SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SOFTWARE</p>
<p><strong>Verified by:</strong> Project owner</p>
<p><strong>Verification tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Content Correctness</strong></p>
<p>The product owner (and really the end-users) is best positioned to validate that the requirements are <em>correct</em>. This verification should occur during the weekly sprint planning meetings.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s worth reviewing the change request and ensuring that the requirements documented in SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SOFTWARE are consistent with your understanding.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Formal Correctness</strong></p>
<p>Review the documented requirements, ensuring they</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>balance completeness with utility</p></li>
<li><p>don’t contradict each other [[62304:5.2.6.b]]</p></li>
<li><p>have unambiguous descriptions [[62304:5.2.6.c]]</p></li>
<li><p>each has a unique identifier [[62304:5.2.6.e]]</p></li>
<li><p>are stated in terms that permit the establishment of test criteria and performance of tests to determine whether the test criteria have been met [[62304:5.2.6.d]].</p></li>

<h3>Issue - Design Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-design-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Software items are added, removed, or their architecture is modified</p>
<p><strong>Performed by:</strong> Engineer implementing, or planning for, the change</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> The existing architecture, risk analysis, and requirements</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Determine Architectural Design</strong></p>
<p>Determine the architectural changes needed to meet the new requirements. Keep in mind the existing architecture and risks associated with the change.</p>
<p>Are you adding new software items or just changing existing items? Are you removing anything?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation Need for Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Is it necessary to document anything? Typically the high-level “why” questions are the most important to document, as they’re not usually represented in the code. If you are making small changes or if there is nothing useful to document, then you can skip this activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Update the Architectural Diagrams</strong></p>
<p>Prefer block diagrams and flow charts to textual descriptions and include these diagrams in the SDS. Indicate which software items are SOUP.</p>
<p>We’re using the <a class="reference external" href="https://c4model.com">C4 Model</a> on this project. See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">regulatory/model.c4</span></code> for details. Several images, stored in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tmp/architecture</span></code>, are generated from this file using <a class="reference external" href="https://structurizr.com">Structurizr</a>. There is a [useful online-editor] (<a class="reference external" href="https://structurizr.com/dsl">https://structurizr.com/dsl</a>) that can be used to more conveniently modify this file.</p>
<p>Show the software and hardware interfaces between the software items and external software [[62304:5.3.2]].</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Add a Section to the SDS</strong></p>
<p>Textual descriptions are often necessary in addition to architectural diagrams. These detailed designs should be stored as closely as possible to their corresponding source files. (The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rdm</span> <span class="pre">collect</span></code> subcommand can pull comments from source files into YAML so they can be included in the SDS.)</p>
<p>Include detailed descriptions if they seem useful.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>User Interface Design</strong></p>
<p>If you’re making large changes to the user interface, you need to first create user interface mockups. Don’t begin implementing the changes until the product owner has approved the user interface mockups.</p>
<p>If you’re modifying an existing UI, consider updating the mockup first.</p>
<p>Include the UI mockups in the SDS as appropriate.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Identify Existing or New Hazardous Situations</strong></p>
<p>Can the software modules being worked on contribute to any of the hazardous situations listed in RISK MANAGEMENT FILE?</p>
<p>Can you think of hazardous situations that are not listed? If so, record them in SOFTWARE RISK MANAGEMENT FILE.</p>
<p>[[62304:7.1.1]]</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Document Sequences of Events</strong></p>
<p>If any hazardous situations were identified in the previous step, then record any sequences of events that may lead to those hazardous situations in SOFTWARE RISK MANAGEMENT FILE [[Fulfills 62304:7.1.4 and 62304:7.1.5, and also fulfills 62304:7.3.2 and 62304:7.4.1.a, since risk control measures are created with the same process. Note that although IEC 62304 distinguishes between sequences of events leading to a hazardous situation and software causes of a hazardous situation, we consider the “cause” to mean the penultimate event in the sequence and hence don’t distinguish them in our documentation.]].</p>

<h3>Issue - Adding Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-adding-dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Incorporating a new dependency, or SOUP Software Item, into the software</p>
<p><strong>Performed by:</strong> Engineer adding the dependency</p>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Details regarding the dependency</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Most software dependencies introduce risks. Before incorporating new dependencies, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the dependency strictly necessary? How much effort would it take to implement the provided functionality?</p></li>
<li><p>How widely used is the SOUP? Popular libraries tend to have fewer defects, better documentation, and longer lifetimes. Consider package download counts, issue tracker traffic, and GitLab stars, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the library maintained? Consider the git commit frequency and the number of maintainers.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the project’s license? Be sure it’s compatible with the business needs.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Update Architectural Diagram</strong></p>
<p>Incorporate the new SOUP item into the SDS Documentation as appropriate. The benefit to engineers, especially new engineers, should be balanced with the cost of maintaining the diagrams and the risks associated with outdated diagrams. See the <a class="reference external" href="#project---architectural-design">Project - Architectural Design</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Update SBOM</strong></p>
<p>Information in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">soup.yaml</span></code> file may duplicate information found in other files (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements.txt</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package.json</span></code>).</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially when working on software items with low levels of concern, it can be appropriate to lump a few SOUP packages into a single item within the SBOM file.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">soup.yaml</span></code> should contain a sequence of mappings, each containing the keys in parenthesis below. Some keys are optional. All values must be strings.</p>
<p>The header of each sub-section contains the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">title</span></code> of the SOUP [[62304:8.1.2.a]].</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">manufacturer</span></code> is the name of the company that developed the SOUP. The lack of a manufacturer field is taken that this SOUP was developed collaboratively by the free open-source software community, and Radiotherapy AI Pty Ltd is considered the manufacturer [[62304:8.1.2.b]].</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">version</span></code> of each SOUP is a unique identifier, which specifies the version of the SOUP which is used in the software [[62304:8.1.2.c]]. The version may follow varying formats, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.0.13</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.2r5</span></code>, or even <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2021-05-05</span></code>, as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Investigate</p>
<p>Investigate the problem and, if possible, identify the cause and record it in the problem report [[62304:9.2.a and 62304:9.2.c]]. If possible, also note which software items were involved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Risk Assessment</p>
<p>Evaluate the problem’s relevance to safety using the software <a class="reference external" href="#risk-assessment">risk assessment activity</a> and record the result in the problem report [[62304:6.2.1.3, 62304:9.2.b, and 62304:9.2.c]].</p>
</li>
<li><p>Advise Relevant Parties</p>
<p>If the problem affects devices that have been released, make sure the appropriate people are aware of the situation and have enough information to decide whether and how to notify affected parties, including users and regulators—record who you notified in the problem report.</p>
<p>[[62304:9.3 62304:6.2.5.a and 62304:6.2.5.b details regarding who to inform and how they should be informed are assumed to be handled in other processes, and that all that the software engineers must do is pass along the appropriate details.]]</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fix or Defer</p>
<p>If there’s no need to fix the issue, either because it doesn’t impact safety or otherwise, record the rationale for not taking any action [[62304:9.2.d]]. Discuss with the project lead as appropriate. Note that unaddressed problem reports are included in most regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>If you do fix the issue, then create a merge request that fixes it. The GitLab issue that contains the problem report can also act as the corresponding change request.</p>
<p>If feasible, include an automated test that fails prior to the fix and passes after the fix. If not feasible, record how it was verified that the problem was resolved. Also, be sure the merge request references the problem report [[62304:8.2.4.a and 62304:8.2.4.b]].</p>

<p><strong>Verification tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Problem Report Format</p>
<p>If the problem is present in released medical devices <em>or</em> there is no plan on fixing the problem, then confirm that the problem report is formatted correctly. Also, check that it includes the cause, risk assessment, and justification as to why the issue wasn’t fixed, as appropriate. If the problem was found before it was released and we fixed it, there’s no need to write out all of the details.</p>

<p>Although it’s usually impossible to run the unit and integration tests in a production environment, the test environment should match the production environment as closely as possible. The test record should describe the test environment and should be detailed enough to allow another engineer to re-run the tests [[62304:5.6.7.b and 62304:5.7.5.b]]. In particular, it should include the git commit hash for the state of the code that was built and tested [[62304:9.8.c]]. Dirty working environments aren’t allowed. Details about the SOUP versions should be completely recorded according to the <a class="reference external" href="#soup-configuration-management-plan">SOUP Configuration Management Plan</a> [[62304:9.8.c]]. Any relevant environment variables should also be included. Any testing tools [[62304:9.8.e]] or hardware should also be recorded [[62304:9.8.d]].</p>
<p>Run the unit and integration tests. Include the list of tests that were run and whether they passed or failed [[62304:5.6.7.a 62304:5.7.5.a]].</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manual System Testing</strong></p>
<p>The manual tests will be run on a staging environment that is as similar to the production environment as possible. The test record should describe the staging environment and should be detailed enough to allow the tests to be re-run [[62304:5.6.7.b and 62304:5.7.5.b]].</p>
<p>Run the manual tests. Include the list of tests that were run and whether they passed or failed [[62304:5.6.7.a 62304:5.7.5.a]].</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reporting Test Failures</strong></p>
<p>Any test failures shall be recorded as problem reports [[62304:5.6.8 62304:5.7.4.d]]. See the <a class="reference external" href="#prepare-problem-report">prepare problem report activity</a> for details [[62304:5.7.2]]. If any merge requests are implemented in response to these problem reports, the tests must be re-run [[62304:5.7.3.a 62304:5.7.3.b]]. If it is deemed unnecessary to re-run some of the tests, the justification as to why shall be included in the test record [[62304:5.7.3.c note that the risk management activities for (c) will be handled as part of the unit implementation and testing activity]].</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Completing the Test Record</strong></p>
<p>Finish filling in the rest record. Be sure it records whether the overall test-run passes or fails according to the criteria listed in the <a class="reference external" href="#testing-plan">Testing Plan</a> [[62304:5.6.7.a 62304:5.6.4]].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Completed test record and any problem reports</p>
<p><strong>Verification tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Review Test Record</strong></p>
<p>Ensure the test record is completed correctly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Check that all of the tests have been run.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that there is enough detail to recreate the test environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the overall test-run result is consistent with the <a class="reference external" href="#testing-plan">Testing Plan</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p>[[:Note that we combine our integration and system testing into one activity. We presume that if our integration tests and system tests are passing, no new problems were introduced, per 62304:9.7.d. We also do not distinguish regression tests from tests used for new materiel; we run all of the tests for each release. Therefore, there is no explicit need for regression tests as required in 62304:5.6.6. If the test suite grows very long regression testing may be added in the future.]]</p>

<li><p><strong>Release Verification</strong></p>
<p>Complete these verification steps, filling in the release record that was started during the <a class="reference external" href="#release---planning">Release - Planning activity</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Search the codebase and documentation for the sequence “TODO” comments. Address any that must be fixed prior to this release. None of them need to be fixed for this release. Address any comments</p></li>
<li><p>Review change requests in GitLab. Check that all planned change requests have been implemented and integrated [[62304:5.6.2.a, 62304:5.6.2.b and 62304:9.7.c]]. If there are unimplemented change requests, either move them to the next release or implement them prior to continuing the release activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Review outstanding problem reports. Confirm that none of the known anomalies result in unacceptable risk [[62304:5.8.3, and 62304:5.8.4]]. Confirm that any problem reports that were fixed are closed [[62304:9.7.a]].</p></li>
<li><p>The outputs of each activity are in a consistent state [[62304:5.1.6.c, 62304:5.1.6.d, and 62304:5.8.6]].</p></li>
<li><p>The unit tests adequately verify the software units [[62304:5.5.2]]. If not, create a change request to write unit tests to fill the gaps.</p></li>
<li><p>The integration tests adequately verify the software system [[62304:5.6.5 and 62304:5.7.4.c]]. If not, create a change request to write integration tests to fill the gaps.</p></li>
<li><p>All software requirements can be traced to appropriate verification [[62304:5.7.4.a, 62304:5.7.4.b, 62304:5.7.4.d]].</p></li>
<li><p>Read through the SDS. Make sure it is accurate and appropriately complete. If not, create a change request specifying the gaps that need to be filled.</p></li>
